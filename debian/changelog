  * Merge pull request #164 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/164> from ros-drivers/maint/vlp_32c_support
    Adding VLP-32C support.
    This was tested by AutonomouStuff and several external users. Though it does not include new information that I've learned (it appears that the distance resolution is different <50m vs >=50m), it is a good start.
  * Merge pull request #189 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/189> from kveretennicov/patch-1
  * Fix malformed plugin description XML
    ROS pluginlib only recognizes multiple <library> elements if they are under
    <class_libraries> XML root. It silently ignores malformed XMLs with multiple
    <library> "root"s and just reads the first one, due to relaxed way tinyxml2 does
    parsing. Though if you do rosrun nodelet declared_nodelets, the issue is
    reported properly.
    See also similar issue in https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/131
  * Adding distance_resolution to test yaml files.
  * Adding VLP-32C support.
    Based on work done by @rockcdr. Adds distance_resolution calibration
    value to support 0.004m distance resolution for VLP-32C.

    Previously, transform_node has neither read parameters other than frame_id from the command line nor has it exposed these parameters via dynamic reconfigure. As parameters like max_range and view_width have been initialized to zero, the inconfigurable transform_node has returned an empty point cloud.
    Now, transform_node launches an reconfigure server just as cloud_node. In contrast to cloud_node, transform node exposes another parameter for dynamic reconfiguration: frame_id, i.e. the frame of reference the incoming Velodyne points are transformed to.

  * Fixed azimuth overflow bug.
    For interpolated azimuth values between 35999.5 and 36000.0 the nested round(fmod())
    yields a value of 36000 which is invalid and overflows the pre-computed sin/cos arrays,
    since they only go form 0..35999
