  * Disable cut_angle by default. (#497 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/497>)
  * Unify tf frame parameters between transform and cloud nodes (#344 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/344>) (#453 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/453>)
    * Unify tf frame parameters between transform and cloud nodes
    At this point there is no need any more for cloud node because transform node includes all features of cloud node.

  * 2.1.1
  * Updating for first Galactic release
  * Minor fixes to string formatting. (#396 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/396>)
    These changes will allow velodyne to compile without warnings
    on Rolling (soon to be Galactic).  The changes are also backwards
    compatible to Foxy if we want to backport them.
